# CompilerProject
Experimental Project to Compile Python into low-level stack language
Ilay Guler 2023 -- 

12/23/2023:
  Creating operational semantics & formal grammars for Stack Language
  Implemented helper functions for parsing. Not complete

12/24/2023:
  Mostly completed parser. Will convert a string into a list of stack commands, although the parser needs to be further polished. Negative numbers,
  as well as semicolons between commands need to be delt with.
